# PWSecure
### PW as in PassWord

### TO GET
* download or fork on local machine
* use g++ / mingw / anything to compile c++
* expect a "password.txt" file inside the folder when choosing option 2!

### CONTRIBUTE
* PLEASE! i said please, do not go easy on me, give me any opinion or comments on how to improve this code and how to make a proper project! I'm new in programming so any help would be amazing. Pull request might not be the way (I'm trying to code my self), you can comment and/or create an issue!

my questions / to-study lists are =
- [ ] how to include a text file with data to compile together, or should i make an array on another c++ file and how to do that
- [ ] how to make a proper project and proper file placing (where to place stuff)
- [ ] learn database and how to connect to database
- [ ] using API and/or Framework
- [x] (kinda) using big data and read to c++
